XO is an experimental Go library designed to simplify and streamline development with the **X API**. Born out of frustration with existing solutions that felt clunky, incomplete, or hard to use, XO aims to be a modular, intuitive toolkit for developers building apps that interact with space, stream, user, and tweet data.

##  Why XO?

While building apps that rely on the X API, we noticed a gap: no library felt complete, clean, or developer-friendly enough. XO is our attempt to fix thatâ€”by offering a collection of focused, reusable functions that make working with the X API a breeze.

Whether you're managing user data, streaming tweets, or exploring space-related endpoints, XO is here to help.

## âœ¨ Features (WIP)

- **User Module**: Fetch, update, and manage user profiles
- **Tweet Module**: Post, delete, and stream tweets
- **Stream Module**: Real-time data handling with graceful error recovery
- **Space Module**: Explore and interact with space-related endpoints
- **Modular Design**: Use only what you need, no bloated dependencies

        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
