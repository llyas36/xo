XO is an experimental Go library designed to simplify development with the **X API**. Born out of frustration with existing libraries that felt clunky, incomplete, or hard to use, XO aims to be a modular, intuitive toolkit for developers building apps that interact with space, stream, user, and tweet data.

Whether you're managing user data, streaming tweets, or exploring space-related endpoints, XO is might be a help.

## âœ¨ Features (WIP)

- **User Module**: Fetch, update, and manage user profiles
- **Tweet Module**: Post, delete, and stream tweets
- **Stream Module**: Real-time data handling with graceful error recovery
- **Space Module**: Explore and interact with space-related endpoints
- **Modular Design**: Use only what you need, no bloated dependencies

    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
